given positions, lambda, alphas, betas, 
and a partition
since the sum of information gain maximization function is log concave, 
we can calculate this with grad descent to figure out durations of each node
this maximizes the discounted information gain (discounted based off lambda)

given partition, the positions can also be used with LKH to find route for each partition


find a PARTITION (my part) heuristic that maximizes discounted information gain
